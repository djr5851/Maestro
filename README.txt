My idea for my project is basically to allow users to record a song using
the digital piano and upload it to the server, where it can then be played
back. I'm borrowing the piano from a project I previously worked on.

I'm definitely a little behind as this week has been a little hectic for me
and I ran into a lot of problems getting everything working. For now, the app
is working on a node server, and the user can record and play back songs. Songs
are recorded using an object with all of the notes/times so I plan on using that
for GET/POST requests
